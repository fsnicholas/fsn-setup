Display Linux Commands Cheatsheets With Tealdeer In Terminal

Getting cheatsheets for Unix & Linux commands is made much easier with Tealdeer!

Before start using Tealdeer, you must update its cache with command:

$ tldr --update

Now you can display any Unix and Linux command's cheatsheet with Tealdeer client like below:

tldr command_name

For example, I am going to display ls command's cheatsheet using Tealdeer using this command:

$ tldr ls

The Tealdeer client will fetch the requested cheatsheet from the tldr-pages project and display it in your Terminal.

Here is the sample output of above command:

  List directory contents.

  List files one per line:

      ls -1

  List all files, including hidden files:

      ls -a

  List all files, with trailing `/` added to directory names:

      ls -F

  Long format list (permissions, ownership, size and modification date) of all files:

      ls -la

  Long format list with size displayed using human readable units (KB, MB, GB):

      ls -lh

  Long format list sorted by size (descending):

      ls -lS

  Long format list of all files, sorted by modification date (oldest first):

      ls -ltr
